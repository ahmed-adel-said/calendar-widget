## Changelog


### [v1.10.1](https://github.com/plusonelabs/calendar-widget/issues?q=milestone%3A1.10.1)

* Fix issue where widget would crash because of unexpected widgetId
* Translations updates

### [v1.10.0](https://github.com/plusonelabs/calendar-widget/issues?q=milestone%3A1.10.0)

* Added: Different settings for different Widget instances allow you to create any number of
customized views of your events, including configuration of different calendars for different widgets.
All setting are separate for each Widget instance. In order not to get confused in 
configurations of different widgets, you can launch "Calendar Widget" with your Android Launcher 
and you will be presented with a widget selection list. Each widget can be given its name 
to ease configuring. See [screenshots](https://github.com/plusonelabs/calendar-widget/issues/37#issuecomment-290968481). 
* Added: "Show day headers" option to disable day headers completely.
* Added: The alternative widget layout: "All in one row". Each event can now occupy literally one line 
only. "Appearance -> Event entry layout" option allows 
to switch between the "Time below title" layout and this new one. When used with the
"Show day headers" option, this layout almost doubles number of events visible in a widget without scrolling.
"Days from Today" column replaces day headers in a case the Day Headers are 
turned off. See [screenshots](https://github.com/plusonelabs/calendar-widget/issues/42#issuecomment-289261236).
* Added: "Abbreviate dates" option allows to have shorter date format for both Widget and Day headers.
* Added: "Lock time zone" option to show events in the same Time Zone when travelling to different time zones.
* Added: "Show only the closest instance of a recurring event". You can set 
"Event Filters"->"Date range" to "One year", and your agenda won't be an endless list of the same events.
* Improved: Use space or commas in "Hide based on keywords in a title". Place a text in single or
double quotes in order to have space or comma in a filter.
* Android 7 compatibility, including support of permissions introduced in Android 6.
